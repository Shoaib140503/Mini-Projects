# Face Recognition
Facial Recognition System is a technology capable of matching a human face from a digital image or a video frame against a database of faces, typically employed to authenticate users through ID verification services, works by pinpointing and measuring facial features from a given image.

We'll be building a face recognition model that uses Siamese Networks to give us a distance value that indicates whether 2 images are same or different.

The Dataset
We'll be using the Extracted Faces from face-recognition-dataset, which is derived from the LFW Dataset. The Extracted Faces contains faces extracted from the base images using Haar-Cascade Face-Detection (CV2).

The dataset contains 1324 different individuals, with 2-50 images per person.
The images are of size (128,128,3) and are encoded in RGB.
Each folder and image is named with a number, i.e 0.jpg, 1.jpg
